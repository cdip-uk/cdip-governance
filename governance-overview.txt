# CDIP Governance Overview


## Goals

Data Cooperative platform governed by DLT (possibly DAO)


### Subgoals

Platform that explores participation mechanisms


## Requirements from focus groups

- Veto rights for data access on individual and collective level

- Feedback on data use


### Mitigating concerns and potential pitfalls

- Expert vetos to compensate for health data literacy deficit

- Delegated consent/voting rights for carers

- Incentivisation as means for social justice, but needs safeguard from exploitation

- Limit technical knowledge to participate in collective decision making



## Other implementations

- Proposal making 


- Decision-making mechanism?



## General notes from lit review

Lots of literature refers to commons governance and or similar governance of common pool resources such as treasuries.

Non take up syndicalist literature and  works in political economy is limited to Ostrom (Governance of commons)



## Forms of decision making

### Zones for decision making

Zone A: Data Access

- Individual Data Access
- Collective Data Access
- Selective Data Access

Zone B:
- Technical development of platform

Zone C: 
- Governance structures
- Voting for members, committees, custodians

Zone D: 
- Financial aspects


### Voting mechanisms

#### Permissioned relative majority

#### Conviction voting

voting mechanism in which people stake their voting power on proposals, and over time, those proposals accumulate enough votes to pass.

## Possible mapping for workshop

Zone A: Data Access

-----

- Individual Data Access

Scenario: Voting on a proposal 

Opt-in with veto for individual data access

Options: 
Yes/Approve for opt-in

No/Pass for opt-out

Provisional: Opt-in if it gets majority vote

Delegation

Voting mechanism: 
Voting with redemption option

-----

- Collective Data Access

Scenario: Approve organisation to become permanent collaborator (e.g. University of  Manchester)

Options: 
Yes/Approve
No/Pass
Delegation 

Voting mechanism:
Super majority

-----

- Selective Data Access

Voting on a proposal that only impacts a subset of data, e.g. everybody with Asthma or diabetes

-> Similar to Individual Access? 

-----

Zone B:
- Technical development of platform
Too complex for participants? 
-----

Zone C: 
- Governance structures

Scenario: Mission statement change proposal

Voting mechanism: Consensus

Options: 
Yes/Approve
No/Pass

-----

- Voting for members, committees, custodians

Scenario: Voting for committee member

Voting mechanism: staked or ranked voting

-----

Zone D: 
- Financial aspects
